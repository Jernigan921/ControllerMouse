# ControllerMouse
This lets you control the mouse with an xbox controller. It's great for when you want to sit back and scroll through Youtube,
Netflix, Hulu, Reddit, or anyother site on your computer with an xbox controller. 

Controls: 
Tap A to Left Click, Tap A agian to release Left Click
Tap B for Right Click
Left Joystick allows for the mouse movement.
Right Joystick allows for the scroll wheel movement.
Down on the DPad allows for the controller to be turned off/on.

Problems as of 6.12.2019: 
The mouse movement in not optimized.
I would like to get the A button on press and A button on released to simulate the mouse instead of the double tap.
